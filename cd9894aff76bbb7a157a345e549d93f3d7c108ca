@weaverryan I've pushed the rebased commit. As for #45, how will it help and affect this PR?

When someone uses a default build which has been disabled, the error message is: `Given entry point "_default" is not configured`.

Maybe we could try to determine which builds are configured and offer them as an alternative in the error message, e.g: `The default build is not enabled. Use one of "frontend", "backend", "app1", "app2" builds.`
