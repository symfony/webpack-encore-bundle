@weaverryan is there anything else needed with this PR?

@weaverryan I have updated the PR. Sorry for the long wait. Also all the tests passed? There appears to be a deprecation warning from PHP unit that caused Travis to fail.

I'm going to wait for #17 and #21 before this one - especially #21, which may need to add a constructor arg to `EntrypointLookup` to fix a bug.

Thanks!
