@weaverryan Could you please press "Merge pull request" button and make a new release? We already have 3 approvals in this PR.

I love how webpack encore improved my frontend workflow in so many ways. But the wait for this PR is very worrisome. It is a very basic commit that keep this bundle in sync with the Symfony ecosystem that it's supposed to be part of.

Sorry - will merge tonight. This bundle is my responsibility and Iâ€™ve been a bit busy - apologies for the inconvenience!
